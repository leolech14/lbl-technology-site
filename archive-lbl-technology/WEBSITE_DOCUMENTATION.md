## Visual Design

### Color Palette

The website employs a carefully crafted dark petroleum color scheme:

```css
--petroleum-dark: #0a1628    /* Deep navy base */
--petroleum-medium: #162e4d  /* Medium blue-grey */
--petroleum-light: #1e3a5f   /* Lighter petroleum blue */
--glass-bg: rgba(10, 22, 40, 0.3)  /* Transparent overlay */
--glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)  /* Subtle borders */
--text-primary: #e0e7ff      /* Light lavender text */
--text-secondary: #a5b4fc    /* Muted purple-blue text */
--accent-cyan: #06b6d4       /* Bright cyan accents */
--accent-gold: #d4a574       /* Warm gold accents */
```

### Typography

The design system uses a dual-font approach:
- **Primary Font**: Inter (300-700 weights) - Modern, clean sans-serif for body text and UI elements
- **Display Font**: Cinzel (400, 600 weights) - Elegant serif for the brand name, adding gravitas and sophistication

Font hierarchy follows a modular scale for consistent sizing throughout the interface.

### Background and Visual Effects

#### Babylonian Gate Background
The site features a majestic Babylonian gate image as a fixed background, symbolizing:
- Historical foundations of technology and civilization
- Gateway to advanced solutions
- Architectural excellence and timeless design

The background is enhanced with layered gradients:
- Top-to-bottom overlay gradient (70% â†’ 92% opacity)
- Radial gradients for depth and atmosphere
- Fallback gradient pattern for image loading states

#### Glassmorphism Implementation

Advanced glass-morphism effects create depth and visual hierarchy:

```css
backdrop-filter: blur(12px) saturate(150%)
background: rgba(10, 22, 40, 0.4-0.6)
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)
box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
```
